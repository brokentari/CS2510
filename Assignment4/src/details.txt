	You only need to provide the methods on parameters for additional method-level templates.
196: YuTing Ger -- (Error) [-1.0]
	for the left part of the tree, you should pass in (leftTheta - 90) to changeDegree.

210: YuTing Ger -- (Error) [-2.0]
	To find the width of a tree, you find the distance between the rightmost point of the tree and the leftmost point of the tree. The leftmost should be Math.min(0, the current point/base of this tree + the leftmost of the rest of it (this.tree)). The rightmost should be similar but with Math.max instead.
353: YuTing Ger -- (Error) [-1.0]
	for the left part of the tree, you should pass in (leftTheta - 90) to changeDegree.
The given example tree1.combine(40, 50, 150, 30, tree2):
- to rotate tree1 to 150, you need to rotate it by 60 degrees (to the left)



355: YuTing Ger -- (Error) [-2.0]
		To find the width of a tree, you find the distance between the rightmost point of the tree and the leftmost point of the tree. Implementation should be similar to stem but there is a possibility that the leftmost point could be on the right branch depending on the angle and vice versa.
436: YuTing Ger -- (Error) [-1.0]
	Missing a test case for a Stem with the expected outcome being true.
455: YuTing Ger -- (Error) [-1.0]
